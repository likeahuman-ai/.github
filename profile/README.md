## Philosophy

We believe AI should feel natural — not like a tech demo. Every product we ship is designed to be used daily by people who don't care about the technology behind it. They just want it to work, and work well.

- **Ship fast, iterate faster** — Prototypes in days, not months
- **AI as a feature, not a gimmick** — Intelligence where it adds value
- **Design matters** — If it doesn't look good, nobody uses it
- **1% for the planet** — We commit 1% of all revenue to climate action through [Justdiggit](https://justdiggit.org)
