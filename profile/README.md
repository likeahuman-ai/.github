# Like a Human

**AI-first product studio based in the Netherlands.**

We design and build intelligent platforms that feel intuitive — not robotic. From concept to production, we ship AI-powered products that solve real problems for real businesses.

## What we build

- **AI-powered dashboards** — Data platforms with built-in intelligence, proactive alerts, and conversational AI copilots
- **Automation systems** — Smart workflows that replace manual processes with AI-driven decisions
- **Full-stack web products** — Modern, production-grade applications from backend to UI

## Our stack

`Next.js` `TypeScript` `Convex` `Clerk` `Tailwind CSS` `Vercel AI SDK` `GSAP`

## Philosophy

We believe AI products should feel natural — not like a tech demo. Every product we ship is designed to be used daily by people who don't care about the technology behind it. They just want it to work, and work well.

- **Ship fast, iterate faster** — Prototypes in days, not months
- **AI as a feature, not a gimmick** — Intelligence where it adds value
- **Design matters** — If it doesn't look good, nobody uses it
